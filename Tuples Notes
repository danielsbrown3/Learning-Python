Cant sort a Tuple, very efficient because can store densly
Lists take extra memory to have the tools to change them

Tuple assignment
(x,y)= (4,'fred') # x = 4 , y = 'fred'

Tuples compare from the left to the right, once one statement is true it returns true if it goes through the whole list it returns false

Sorting by values instead of key
Dictionary sorts by key whereas, we are able to sort by value with tuples

c={'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}
tmp=list()
for k,v in c.items()
  tmp.append( (v,k) )
print(tmp)
=> [(10,'a') (22,'c'), (1,'b')]

tmp=sort(tmp,reverse=True)
=>[(22,'c'),(10,'a'),(1,'b')]
