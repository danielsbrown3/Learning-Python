y= re.findall('[0-9]+',x)
checks for 0 - 9 
super op, checks even if its one instance in a string, has to include at least one number from 0 to 9 to return true

Greedy matching prefers the longest match
x = 'From: Using the : character'
y=re.findall('^F.+:',x)
print(y)
>>['From: Using the :']

Non-Greedy matching prefers the shortest match

x = 'From: Using the : character'
y=re.findall('^F.+?:',x)
print(y)
>>['From: ']

import re
hand=open('file name')
numlist=list()
for line in hand:
  line=line.rstrip()
  stuff=re.findall('([0-9.]+'),line
  if len(stuff)!=1:continue
  num=float(stuff[0])
  numlist.append(num)
print(numlist)
