#Goal is to play a game of rock, paper, scissors with the computer.

#First gonna import random library
import random

#Next gonna create variables for player and computer choice and prompt player with input
def get_choices():
  player=input("Which do you wish to play (rock, paper, or scissors):")
  computer=random.choice(["rock", "paper" , "scissors"]) #selects randomly a string
  choices= {"player":player,"computer":computer} #creates a vector of strings
  return choices #returns the vector

#Next we need to create nested if statements to determine whether we won or lost
def win_condition(player,computer): #Takes two input variables
  print(f"Player has selected {player} and computer has selected {computer}") #print function allows us to call variables in between {}
  if player == computer: #true or false if 
    return "It has been a tie"
    
  elif player == "rock":
    if computer == "scissors":
      return "You have smashed scissors. You WIN!"
    else: #else is indented with its corresponding if
      return "You have been smothered by paper. You LOSE!"
    
  elif player == "paper":
    if computer == "rock":
      return "You have smothered rock. You WIN!"
    else:
      return "You have been sliced by scissors. You LOSE!"

  elif player == "scissors":
    if computer == "paper":
      return "You have sliced paper. You WIN!"
    else:
        return "You have been crushed by rock. You LOSE!"

#Now we need to call our choices function
storeChoices=get_choices()

#Next we input our two variables into the win/loss checker
result= win_condition(storeChoices["player"],storeChoices["computer"])

#Print the output of win_condition function
print(result)
